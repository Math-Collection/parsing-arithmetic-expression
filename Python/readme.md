Small Python code example to demonstarte the new approach for expression parsing. It is assumed that input-expression is valid and already tokenized (no blank spaces, no multi-character tokens) - the focus is at new parsing algorithm here. The algorithm itself can be seen in the "rpn" function, in code.
